excerpt: Open source is at the heart of what we do. Here's why we believe in giving back to the community and how it has shaped our company culture.

Every tool we build internally eventually faces the same question: should we open source this? More often than not, our answer is yes. Here's why.

## Standing on Shoulders

Our entire technology stack is built on open source. Linux, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL—the list goes on. We've benefited enormously from the work of thousands of contributors. Open sourcing our tools is how we pay it forward.

## Better Software

Code that's going to be public gets extra scrutiny. Before open sourcing, we:

- Clean up documentation
- Remove hardcoded assumptions
- Think harder about API design
- Write better tests

The result? Better software, even for our internal use.

## Attracting Talent

Developers want to work on interesting problems with talented people. Our open source projects serve as a portfolio that shows:

- The quality of our code
- The problems we solve
- How we collaborate

Several of our best hires discovered us through our GitHub repos.

## Community Input

Open source users find bugs we'd never catch, suggest features we'd never imagine, and sometimes contribute fixes themselves. A diverse user base makes the software more robust.

## What We've Learned

Not everything should be open sourced. We keep proprietary:

- Business logic specific to our products
- Code that would create security risks if public
- Projects too immature to maintain publicly

For everything else, the benefits of openness outweigh the costs.

## Getting Started

Thinking about open sourcing something? Start with:

1. Clean up the README
2. Add a LICENSE file
3. Set up issue templates
4. Document contribution guidelines

Then ship it. You can iterate from there.

The open source community has given us so much. We're grateful for the opportunity to give back.
