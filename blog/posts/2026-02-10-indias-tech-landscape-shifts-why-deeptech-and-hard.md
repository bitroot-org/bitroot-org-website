## Introduction to a New Era
We just spotted an exciting update from Zerodha founder Nithin Kamath that's worth sharing with the community. He warns that India can no longer rely on IT service exports and needs to move its focus to deeptech and hardware. This shift is essential to build long-term economic resilience and reduce dependence on global outsourcing cycles.

## Why This Matters for Developers
Here's why this matters for developers: the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the game. As AI becomes capable of generating the majority of software, the 'asset-light' business models that dominated the last decade will struggle. The next 10 years will belong to 'atoms, not just bits,' with capital going into physical infrastructure, including defense systems, batteries, and semiconductors.

## Key Takeaways
What caught our attention about this update is the emphasis on self-sufficiency in technology. Kamath highlights the need for India to build domestic deep tech capabilities to stay competitive. Some key points to consider include:
* The need for a broader national competition to build high-density hubs
* The importance of investing in deep tech, as it's still 'day one' for this industry
* The emergence of AI and its potential to disrupt traditional business models

## Implications and Potential Use Cases
The implications of this shift are significant. As India moves its focus to deeptech and hardware, we can expect to see new opportunities emerge in areas like:
* Semiconductor manufacturing
* Advanced manufacturing equipment
* Defense systems
* Batteries and renewable energy

## Conclusion
In conclusion, India's tech landscape is shifting, and it's essential for the country to adapt to stay competitive. By focusing on deeptech and hardware, India can build long-term economic resilience and reduce its dependence on global outsourcing cycles. We're excited to see how this shift will play out and the new opportunities that will emerge as a result.
