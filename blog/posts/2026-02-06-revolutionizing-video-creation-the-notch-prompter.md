  Moody is a notch teleprompter for Mac.


  It helps you speak clearly during…


  video recordings,

  online meetings,

  presentations,

  and live demos.


  The main idea is simple.


  Your script stays right next to your camera, in the notch.


  So when you read your text…


  you still keep natural eye contact.


  And Moody can follow your voice.


  So when you stop speaking…


  it pauses.


  And when you continue…


  it scrolls again.


  That makes it feel very natural.


  Moody is useful for creators…


  remote workers…


  and presenters.


  Because you can follow your script…


  stay calm…


  and deliver your message smoothly.


  You can control the scrolling speed…


  adjust the text size…


  and place it exactly where you want.


  Moody is basically an invisible presentation assistant…


  always near your camera…


  helping you stay focused…


  and speak with confidence.


  You can try Moody on Mac.


  That’s it.".'
