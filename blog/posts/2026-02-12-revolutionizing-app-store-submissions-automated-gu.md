## Introduction to the Game-Changer
We just spotted an exciting update from Landseer Enga that's worth sharing with the community - a CLI tool that scans your iOS app against every App Store guideline before you submit. This tool is a total game-changer for developers, saving time and reducing the risk of rejection.

## What the Tool Offers
Here's what caught our attention about this tool: it checks for a wide range of compliance issues, including:
* Payment & IAP compliance
* Privacy manifests & data usage declarations
* Required sign-in & account management flows

* Binary & entitlement validation

## Why This Matters for Developers
What's really exciting about this tool is that it not only identifies issues but also fixes them, thanks to its integration with Claude Code. This means developers can scan, fix, and repeat until their app is passing with flying colors. The implications are huge - no more tedious manual checks or rejections due to overlooked guidelines.


## Potential Use Cases and Implications
The community is buzzing about the potential use cases for this tool, from streamlining the development process to reducing the stress of App Store submissions. With this tool, developers can focus on what matters most - building amazing apps - while leaving the compliance checks to the automated expert.
