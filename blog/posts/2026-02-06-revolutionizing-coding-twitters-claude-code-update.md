## Introduction to Claude Code Update
We just spotted an exciting update from Twitter that's worth sharing with the community: Claude Code now supports agent teams. This feature is currently in research preview, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we code. 

## What's the Big Deal?
Here's what caught our attention about this update: instead of a single agent working through a task sequentially, a lead agent can delegate to multiple teammates that work in parallel. This means faster research, debugging, and building, all while coordinating with each other. 

## Key Features and Benefits
Some of the key benefits of this update include:
* Faster coding: with multiple agents working in parallel, coding tasks can be completed much quicker
* Improved efficiency: agent teams can work together to research, debug, and build, making the coding process more efficient
* Enhanced collaboration: lead agents can coordinate with their teammates, making it easier to work on complex projects

## Why This Matters for Developers
Here's why this matters for developers: with Claude Code's agent teams, developers can focus on higher-level tasks while the agents handle the more mundane work. This can lead to increased productivity and better work-life balance. 

## Potential Use Cases
The community is buzzing about the potential use cases for this update, including:
* Automating repetitive coding tasks
* Improving code quality and accuracy
* Enhancing collaboration and teamwork among developers

## Getting Started
To try out this feature, developers can enable agent teams in their settings.json. We're excited to see how this update will change the way we code, and we can't wait to hear about your experiences with Claude Code's agent teams.
