## Introduction to Agent Teams
We just spotted an exciting update from Claude Code that's worth sharing with the community - the introduction of agent teams. This feature enables multiple Claude Code instances to work together, making it ideal for tasks that require parallel exploration. Here's what caught our attention about this innovative approach.

## What are Agent Teams?
Agent teams are designed to coordinate multiple Claude Code instances, each working independently on a specific task. One instance acts as the team lead, assigning tasks, synthesizing results, and managing the team. Team members can communicate directly with each other, making it easier to share findings and collaborate on complex tasks.

## Key Features and Benefits
Some key features of agent teams include:
* Parallel exploration: multiple team members can work on different aspects of a task simultaneously
* Direct communication: team members can message each other directly, enhancing collaboration and reducing misunderstandings
* Task coordination: the team lead assigns tasks and manages the team, ensuring that work is completed efficiently
* Flexible display modes: choose from in-process or split-pane modes to suit your workflow

## Use Cases and Implications
The community is buzzing about the potential use cases for agent teams. Some examples include:
* Research and review: multiple team members can investigate different aspects of a problem, sharing and challenging each other's findings
* New module or feature development: team members can own separate pieces of the project, working independently without conflicts
* Debugging with competing hypotheses: team members can test different theories in parallel, converging on a solution faster

## Getting Started with Agent Teams
To enable agent teams, simply add the CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS environment variable to your settings.json file. Then, tell Claude to create an agent team and describe the task and team structure you want in natural language. Claude will create the team, spawn team members, and coordinate work based on your prompt.

## Best Practices and Next Steps
For the best results with agent teams, keep the following best practices in mind:
* Give team members enough context to work independently
* Size tasks appropriately to avoid bottlenecks
* Wait for team members to finish before shutting down the team
* Start with research and review to ensure everyone is on the same page
* Avoid file conflicts by using separate files or folders for each team member

With agent teams, Claude Code is pushing the boundaries of collaborative coding. We're excited to see how this feature will enhance productivity and streamline complex tasks for developers and tech enthusiasts.
