Technical writing is hard enough without bad typography making it worse. Here's how thoughtful type choices can make documentation clearer and more enjoyable.

## Choosing Fonts

For technical content, we prioritize:

**Body text**: A readable sans-serif with clear letterforms. We like Inter, IBM Plex Sans, and Source Sans Pro. Avoid fonts with ambiguous characters (is that an l, I, or 1?).

**Code**: A monospace font with distinct characters. JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, and IBM Plex Mono work well. Ligatures are a matter of taste.

**Headings**: Can match body text or provide contrast. Slightly heavier weights help establish hierarchy.

## Establishing Hierarchy

Readers scan before they read. Help them with clear hierarchy:

- **Size contrast**: Each heading level should be noticeably different
- **Weight contrast**: Bold headings, regular body text
- **Spacing**: More space above headings than below
- **Color**: Use sparingly, but consistently

## Line Length and Spacing

The optimal line length for reading is 50-75 characters. Too wide and eyes lose their place; too narrow and reading becomes choppy.

Line height (leading) should be 1.4-1.6 for body text. Tighter for headings, looser for large blocks of text.

## Code Typography

Code blocks need special attention:

- Use a true monospace font
- Ensure adequate contrast for syntax highlighting
- Don't let lines overflow—wrap or scroll gracefully
- Match indentation to the surrounding content's spacing

## Responsive Considerations

Typography must work across devices:

- Base font size of 16-18px minimum
- Relative units (rem, em) for scalability
- Adjust line length on wider screens
- Test on actual devices, not just browser resizing

## The Details Matter

Small touches that improve technical typography:

- Proper quotation marks (" ") not straight quotes
- Em dashes (—) not hyphens for breaks
- Non-breaking spaces before units
- Consistent capitalization

## Start Improving

You don't need a complete redesign to improve typography. Start with:

1. Audit your current font choices
2. Check line lengths on different devices
3. Review heading hierarchy
4. Test code block readability

Good typography is invisible—readers notice when it's bad, not when it's good. That's exactly what we're aiming for.
